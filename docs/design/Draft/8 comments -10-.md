Comments

==========

Comments can potentially be attached to any item (but mostly tickets)

Should things other than blocks of text be storable in comments? (maybe references to commits or some such)

Database

--------

- id

- timestamp

- comment_number

- object_type ?? (atm only tickets...unless we can comment on comments)

- object_id

- content
